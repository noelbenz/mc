== Version 1.1.0

**Backpack**

* Added @Simply Backpack - Due to the excessive number of types of stones added to the game, your inventory will quickly become full when mining. To alleviate this problem, I've added the Simply Backapck mod which adds backpacks that can be configured to auto-pickup items. You can whitelist which items the backpack should pick up for each backpack you make. The first tier is relatively easy to craft, and it has four tiers in total. Checkout the `Common Backpack` item to get started. Sneak (Shift) + Right Click to configure the backpack's item whitelist.
* I disabled the other backpack mod's recipes (except for the ender backpack) since they're less featureful and more expensive.

**Item, fluid, and energy pipes**

Thermal Expansion does not include any item, fluid, or energy pipes in 1.15.2 and there's no plan to add them according to their discord. Mekanism has pipes you can use, but it's harder to get started and less intuitive.

* Added @Refined Pipes - Refined pipes fills that niche pretty well and is easy to get into. All of the pipes use vanilla materials and it works similarly to Thermal's.
* Added @XNet - Adds networking cable for transfering items, fluids, energy, and information. Great for making small crafting networks. It's kind of like a miniature AE2. A nice benefit of this mod is the cables are optimized so servers perform better.

**Chunk Loading**

I found out that ChickenChunks mod is broken for 1.15.2. So I added 2 new ones that I've confirmed do work. Use whichever mod you prefer but remember to keep your loaded chunks to just what you need for server performance considerations.

Note: Use F3 + G to enable chunk visuals. This will allow you to see the boundaries of chunks.

* Added @FTB Chunks - Adds the ability to claim chunks and force them to stay loaded so your machines will continue running even while you're away from your base or offline. To access the chunk map, click on the map icon in the top-left corner of your inventory menu. Then click the map in the top-left corner again. You can left click and drag to claim chunks. Only you or players on your team can place, destroy, or use blocks in your claimed chunks. To force chunks to stay loaded, shift + left click and drag over claimed chunks. You'll see a stripped pattern over force loaded chunks. These chunks will stay loaded even when no players are around.
* Added @Chunk Loaders - Adds placeable chunk loader blocks that keep your chunks loaded. There's different tiers, each one covers a larger area. You can right click the block to see the chunks that are loaded, and click them to toggle them on or off. You can even break the basic chunk loader block, which loads a 3x3 area, down into 9 mini chunk loaders which each load 1 chunk.
* Disabled @ChickenChunks chunk loaders as they are currently not working.

**Other**

* Added @Trash Slot - Adds a slot to your inventory for deleting items. Can be toggled on/off with the `T` key by default (Show / Hide TrashSlot)
* Added @Basic Nether Ores - Adds ores to the nether to make it more enticing.
* Added @Enchantment Descriptions and @JEI Enchantments - Adds descriptions to enchantments.

**Updated Mods**

* Updated Toolbelt mod

== Version 1.0.1

* Morpheus - Only 50% of the players need to go to sleep to skip nighttime (not sure if it rounds up or down, percentage is configurable)
* Inventory Tweaks - Now when your tool breaks or you place the last block in your hand, the game will automatically refill it with the next tool or block of the same type.
